# Supabase Database Setup

This directory contains SQL scripts for setting up the database schema and security policies for your Next.js application with role-based access control.

## Files

- `schema.sql` - Main database schema with tables, relationships, RLS policies, and initial roles
- `setup-test-admin.sql` - Helper script to set up a test admin user

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project
2. Note down your project URL and anon/public key for your environment variables

### 2. Run the Schema Script

1. Go to SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy the contents of `schema.sql` into a new query
3. Run the SQL script to create all tables, policies, and initial roles

### 3. Set Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env.local` file has these values (using your Supabase project credentials):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Create an Admin User

#### Option 1: Using the Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to Authentication â†’ Users in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click "Add User"
3. Add an email and password for your admin user
4. Run the following SQL to set up the admin profile:

```sql
-- Get the Admin role ID
DO $$
DECLARE
    admin_role_id UUID;
BEGIN
    SELECT id INTO admin_role_id FROM public.employee_roles WHERE name = 'Admin';
    
    -- Insert user profile for the admin user
    INSERT INTO public.user_profiles (
        id, 
        first_name, 
        last_name, 
        email, 
        role_id, 
        active
    )
    SELECT 
        id, 
        'Admin', 
        'User', 
        email, 
        admin_role_id, 
        true 
    FROM 
        auth.users 
    WHERE 
        email = 'your_admin_email@example.com';
END $$;
```

#### Option 2: Using the Helper Script

1. Go to SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy the contents of `setup-test-admin.sql` into a new query
3. Run the SQL script to set up a test admin user
4. Follow the instructions provided by the script output

### 5. Test Authentication

1. Use your Next.js app's login form to log in with your admin credentials
2. Verify that you have proper admin permissions by accessing admin-only routes
3. Check that RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is working correctly

## Table Structure

The database consists of the following main tables:

- `employee_roles` - Role definitions with permissions as JSONB
- `user_profiles` - User profiles with role assignments
- `clients` - Client/customer data 
- `products` - Product inventory
- `vendors` - Vendor/supplier information
- `transactions` - Sales and purchase transactions

## Row-Level Security Policies

Each table has Row-Level Security policies that control access based on user roles:

- **Admin** - Full access to all resources
- **Employee** - Access to clients and transactions
- **Inventory Manager** - Access to products and vendors
- **IT Team** - User management capabilities
- **Vendor** - Limited access to products

## Permissions System

Permissions are stored as JSONB in the `employee_roles` table with this structure:

```json
{
  "resource_name": {
    "read": boolean,
    "create": boolean,
    "update": boolean,
    "delete": boolean
  }
}
```

Use the `hasPermission` function from the auth hook to check permissions in your components.
